# Hey, I'm Alvin 👋

**Engineering Manager | Staff+ Engineer | Remote Team Leader**

I've been writing code since the early 2000s—back when ActionScript 3.0 was cutting-edge; making flash sites in highschool for my local bands and uploading flash games to Newgrounds. I was around when JavaScript wasn't even considered a "real" language. Fast forward through the web revolution, and now I'm navigating the AI transformation that's reshaping how we build and deliver software.

Currently leading a remote engineering team of 5 at IQVIA as Associate Director of Software Development, where I balance hands-on technical work with strategic leadership. I believe the best engineering managers are those who can still architect systems, optimize Docker builds, and debug production issues alongside their teams.

## 🚀 What I Do

**Technical Leadership**
- Lead high-performance remote engineering teams
- Architect and maintain cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker)
- Build data pipelines and ETL processes that process sensitive healthcare data
- Optimize systems for performance

**Engineering Excellence**
- Ruby on Rails + React stack expertise
- AWS services (Lambda, S3, Glue, etc.)
- Data engineering and pipeline architecture
- DevOps and infrastructure automation
- Performance monitoring and observability (Datadog)

**Team & Process**
- Remote team culture and development
- Technical mentoring and career development
- Cross-functional collaboration with product and business teams
- Process improvement and automation

## 🎯 Current Focus

The AI revolution reminds me of the early web days—exciting, scary, and full of potential. What excites me most is how AI is becoming our common language for translating complex requirements into user value. I'm exploring how engineering teams can leverage AI to accelerate development while maintaining quality and security standards.
