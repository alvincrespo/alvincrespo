## About Me

Currently serving as Associate Director at IQVIA, where I lead a team of amazing engineers on our platform product. I specialize in building distributed systems that scale both technically and organizationally.

My engineering philosophy centers on sustainable architecture and team empowerment. I believe the best technical solutions emerge when engineers understand both the business context and have the autonomy to innovate within clear architectural boundaries.

## Technical Leadership

TBD

#### Key Achievements

**Leadership**
- Led the delivery of a year long modernization project
- Guided the promotion of internal engineers to senior levels
- Established engineering career ladders with clear progression paths
- Built and scaled fully remote engineering team across multiple global geographic regions

**Technical**
- Architected dual-runtime migration strategy enabling zero-downtime platform transitions
- Reduced query execution time from 30 minutes to 5 seconds through systematic SQL optimization
- Decreased build times by 67% through Docker layer optimization and CI/CD improvements
- Implemented comprehensive observability with Datadog, improving MTTR by 30%.

## Engineering Philosophy

### On Architecture
Every architectural decision should optimize for long-term maintainability and leverage. The best architectures are not the most elegant or technically sophisticated, but those that provide leverage—enabling teams to deliver more value with less effort over time.

### On Team Building
Engineering teams thrive on trust, clear communication, and well-defined processes.

- Trust is built through transparent decision-making and consistent follow-through.
- Communication is explicit and documented—expectations are written with full context, decisions include rationale, and information is accessible to those who need it.
- Processes are intentional—every meeting has a clear purpose and agenda, every decision concludes with defined ownership and next steps.

### On Technical Debt
Technical debt is a misnomer. All deferred work represents prioritization tradeoffs between business value, risk, and resource allocation. Making these tradeoffs explicit is an engineering leader's core responsibility.

## Core Technologies
